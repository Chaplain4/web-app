                            Pizza (English: /ˈpiːtsə/ PEET-sə, Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of
                            Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped
                            with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as various types of
                            sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then
                            baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

                            The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the
                            Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania. Raffaele Esposito
                            is often credited for creating modern pizza in Naples. In 2009, Neapolitan pizza
                            was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish. In 2017,
                            the art of making Neapolitan pizza was added to UNESCO's list of intangible cultural
                            heritage.

                            Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a
                            variety of restaurants, including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean
                            restaurants, via delivery, and as street food. In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is
                            presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork. In casual
                            settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also
                            sold in grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly.
                            They are then cooked using a home oven.

                            In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread
                            over 76,000 pizzerias. Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged two years and over
                            consumed pizza on any given day.

                            Etymology
                            The oldest recorded usage of the word "pizza" is from a Latin text from the town of Gaeta,
                            then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD; the text states that a tenant of certain
                            property is to give the bishop of Gaeta duodecim pizze ("twelve pizzas") every Christmas
                            Day, and another twelve every Easter Sunday.

                            Suggested etymologies include:

                            Byzantine Greek and Late Latin pitta > pizza, cf. Modern Greek pitta bread and the Apulia
                            and Calabrian (then Byzantine Italy) pitta,[14] a round flat bread baked in the oven at high
                            temperature sometimes with toppings. The word pitta can in turn be traced to either Ancient
                            Greek πικτή (pikte), "fermented pastry", which in Latin became "picta", or Ancient Greek
                            πίσσα (pissa, Attic πίττα, pitta), "pitch",[15][16] or πήτεα (pḗtea), "bran" (πητίτης
                            pētítēs, "bran bread").
                            The Etymological Dictionary of the Italian Language explains it as coming from dialectal
                            pinza "clamp", as in modern Italian pinze "pliers, pincers, tongs, forceps". Their origin is
                            from Latin pinsere "to pound, stamp".
                            The Lombardic word bizzo or pizzo meaning "mouthful" (related to the English words "bit" and
                            "bite"), which was brought to Italy in the middle of the 6th century AD by the invading
                            Lombards.[2][19] The shift b>p could be explained by the High German consonant shift, and it
                            has been noted in this connection that in German the word Imbiss means "snack".
                            A small pizza is sometimes called a "pizzetta". A person who makes pizza is known as a
                            "pizzaiolo".

                            The word "pizza" was borrowed from Italian into English in the 1930s; before it became well
                            known, pizza was called "tomato pie" by English speakers. Some regional pizza variations
                            still use the name tomato pie.

                            History

                            Records of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can be found
                            throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian soldiers of the Achaemenid
                            Empire during the rule of Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of
                            their battle shields and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils,
                            herbs, and cheese. An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid,
                            when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until
                            they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men
                            are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables.
                            When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno.
                            In 2023, archeologists discovered a fresco in Pompeii appearing to depict a pizza-like dish
                            among other foodstuffs and staples on a silver platter. Italy's culture minister said it
                            "may be a distant ancestor of the modern dish". The first mention of the word
                            "pizza" comes from a notarial document written in Latin and dating to May 997 AD from Gaeta,
                            demanding a payment of "twelve pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a pork kidney on Christmas Day,
                            and 12 pizzas and a couple of chickens on Easter Day."

                            Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early
                            19th century. Before that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as
                            garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are
                            many conflicting claims, though it certainly could not have been before the 16th century
                            and the Columbian Exchange. Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of
                            pizza bakeries.

                            A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was
                            invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo
                            (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita.
                            Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in
                            the colors of the Italian flag — red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella).
                            Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen, with an official letter
                            of recognition from the Queen's "head of service" remaining to this day on display in
                            Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi. Later research cast doubt on this
                            legend, undermining the authenticity of the letter of recognition, pointing that no media of
                            the period reported about supposed visit and that both the story and name Margherita were
                            first promoted in the 1930s-1940s.

                            Pizza was taken to the United States by Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth
                            century[36] and first appeared in areas where they concentrated. The country's first
                            pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in New York City in 1905. Following World War II, veterans
                            returning from the Italian Campaign, who were introduced to Italy's native cuisine, proved a
                            ready market for pizza in particular.

                            The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a
                            non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote
                            traditional Neapolitan pizza. In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was
                            registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish,[40][41] and
                            in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural
                            heritage.

                            Preparation
                            Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or in portion-size slices. Methods have been
                            developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough,
                            and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are
                            frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.

                            Another form of pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in
                            the store, then sold unbaked to customers to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores
                            sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to assemble at home before baking
                            in an oven.

                            Baking
                            In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with fire bricks above the heat source, an
                            electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven, or, in traditional style in a wood or coal-fired
                            brick oven. The pizza is slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked
                            directly on hot bricks, a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum), or whatever the
                            oven surface is. Before use, a peel is typically sprinkled with cornmeal to allow the pizza
                            to easily slide on and off it. When made at home, a pizza can be baked on a pizza stone
                            in a regular oven to reproduce some of the heating effect of a brick oven. Cooking directly
                            on a metal surface results in too rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning it.[43] Some
                            home chefs use a wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed outdoors. As in restaurants, these
                            are often dome-shaped, as pizza ovens have been for centuries,[44] in order to achieve even
                            heat distribution. Another variation is grilled pizza, in which the pizza is baked directly
                            on a barbecue grill. Greek pizza, like deep dish Chicago and Sicilian style pizza, is baked
                            in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.

                            Most restaurants use standard and purpose-built pizza preparation tables to assemble their
                            pizzas. Mass production of pizza by chains can be completely automated.

                            Crust

                            Caramelised crust – its cornicione (the outer edge) – of slices of New York–style pizza
                            The bottom of the pizza, called the "crust", may vary widely according to style – thin as in
                            a typical hand-tossed Neapolitan pizza or thick as in a deep-dish Chicago-style. It is
                            traditionally plain, but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese.
                            The outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the cornicione. Some pizza dough
                            contains sugar, to help its yeast rise and enhance browning of the crust.

                            Dipping sauce specifically for pizza was invented by American pizza chain Papa John's Pizza
                            in 1984 and has since been adopted by some when eating pizza, especially the crust.

                            Cheese
                            Main article: Pizza cheese
                            Mozzarella cheese is commonly used on pizza, with the buffalo mozzarella produced in the
                            surroundings of Naples. Other cheeses are also used, particularly Italian cheeses
                            including provolone, pecorino romano, ricotta, and scamorza. Less expensive processed
                            cheeses or cheese analogues have been developed for mass-market pizzas to produce desirable
                            qualities like browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture content, and
                            stable shelf life. This quest to create the ideal and economical pizza cheese has involved
                            many studies and experiments analyzing the impact of vegetable oil, manufacturing and
                            culture processes, denatured whey proteins, and other changes in manufacture. In 1997, it
                            was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese was 1 million metric tons (1,100,000
                            short tons) in the U.S. and 100,000 metric tons (110,000 short tons) in Europe.

                            Varieties and styles
                            Main article: List of pizza varieties by country
                            A great number of pizza varieties exist, defined by the choice of toppings and sometimes
                            also crust. There are also several styles of pizza, defined by their preparation method. The
                            following lists feature only the notable ones.

                            Records
                            As of 2021, according to Guinness World Records:

                            The world's largest pizza was prepared in Rome in December 2012, and measured 1,261 square
                            meters (13,570 square feet). The pizza was named "Ottavia" in homage to the first Roman
                            emperor Octavian Augustus, and was made with a gluten-free base.
                            The world's longest pizza was 1,930.39 meters (6,333 feet 3+1⁄2 inches) long; it was made in
                            Fontana, California in 2017. Other previous records include that of Marquinetti
                            (Tomelloso, Spain), where a 1141.5 m pizza was achieved, itself surpassing a previous record
                            in Poland.
                            The world's most expensive commercially available pizza recognised by Guinness World Records
                            costs US$2,700, and was sold at Industry Kitchen (USA) in New York, New York, US, as of 24
                            April 2017. It is made of black squid ink dough, and topped with UK white Stilton cheese,
                            French foie gras and truffles, Ossetra caviar from the Caspian Sea, Almas caviar, and 24K
                            gold leaves.
                            More expensive pizzas have been reported, but are not recognised by Guinness World Records,
                            such as the £4,200 "Pizza Royale 007" at Haggis restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland, which is
                            topped with caviar, lobster, and 24-carat gold dust, and the US$1,000 caviar pizza made by
                            Nino's Bellissima pizzeria in New York City, New York.
                            A pizza made by the restaurateur Domenico Crolla that included toppings such as
                            sunblush-tomato sauce, Scottish smoked salmon, medallions of venison, edible gold, lobster
                            marinated in cognac, and champagne-soaked caviar. The pizza was auctioned for charity in
                            2007, raising £2,150.

                            Pizza and health

                            Boy Scouts with pizza
                            Some pizzas mass-produced by pizza chains have been criticized as having an unhealthy
                            balance of ingredients. Pizza can be high in salt and fat, and is high in calories. The USDA
                            reports an average sodium content of 5,101 mg per 36 cm (14 in) pizza in fast food
                            chains. There are concerns about undesirable health effects.
